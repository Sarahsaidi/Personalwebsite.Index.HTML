                            <h3 class="title">PRIMARY SCHOOL</h3>
                            <p>I started primary school in 2007-2012. I went to school at Sekolah Kebangsaan Padang Jawa and Sekolah Rendah Agama Padang Jawa. While I was at SKPJ, I entered long jump and volleyball events. Also, my sports house is green. During sports day I entered a running event. In 2013, my UPSR trial exam result was 2B 3C.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">SECONDARY SCHOOL</h3>
                    <p>After I finished my primary school, I continued my studies at the secondary level at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seksyen 16 Shah Alam. While I was in form 1-2, I entered the martial arts co-curiculum. But while I was form 3-5, I changed my co-curiculum from martial arts to police cadet. Also, my sports house is red. Next, while school was making sports day, I entered a running competition representing my sports house. Furthermore, I also entered various activities held such as doing visits to old people's homes and I also entered a shooting competition event representing the police cadet co-cuciculum. In 2017, my SPM trial exams result passed with results of 1A-, 1C+, 2C, 3E, 2G.</p>

                    <p>After I finished my studies at the secondary level, I worked for over 1 year before I decided to further my studies at the Diploma level. But due to my unsatisfactory SPM results, I had to enter the Pre-Diploma level first. In 2019, I entered the Pre-Diploma in Commerce at Universiti Teknologi Mara Seri Iskandar, Perak for 6 months. During my time there, I gained various additional knowledge. For example, working together on a task with other teammates. In addition, give a commitment to the assignment given and submit the assignment according to the date and time set by the lecturer.</p>
